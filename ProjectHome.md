**gwTwo**

Aims to become Google Web Toolkit's most immense library of code, widgets & patterns , with the following six dogmatic objectives:

#1 Authored in native Java, at least by 99% percent. The less JavaScript the better (we could also improve the JNI). Also, the more it can mimic existing Java SWT or successfull Swing design patterns and naming the better. **Dont forget to also check objective #3**

#2 Being 100% GWT drop-in compatible, when. Aims to subclass and reuse as many widgets & classes inherent in GWT as possible, for two main reasons
  1. .1 Reducing the learning curve of using it
  1. .2 Improving existing (and future) applications written in GWT, with as little effort as possible.
  1. .3 Be fast ;-) not a main reason (-;

#3 Focus on **real** functionality and substantial improvement of existing widgets (& creating new ones) that add to the user interface functionality & capabilities, instead of fancy effects and smooth animations (we already have two great of those if you're interested MyGWT & GWText). Appearence and effects welcomed but low in the priority!

#4 Widgets should be compatible with the bean architecture (and everything else that is required) so that they can incorporated and utilized by popular GUI designers in eclipse, NetBeans & elsewhere either commercial or open source.

#5 Leverage best practices, algorithms & patterns already available to MyGWT, gwtext and perhaps (a bit) Swing;-) both for widgets but also for behind the scenes code such as MVC style Models (data providers) or Controller patterns and why not Dependency Injection frameworks such as Guice (add your favorite UI java/OO pattern here!).

#6 Be as concise and complete as possible, achieving great functionality with relatively little code from the application developer.
